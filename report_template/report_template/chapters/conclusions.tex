\chapter{Conclusions}
%This final chapter is used to recap what you did in the project. No detail, just a high-level summary of your project (1 page or a bit less is usually enough, but it depends on the specific project).
In conclusion, this project offers a possible implementation of a physical unclonable function (PUF) in order to test the authenticity of a device.
In particular, at the beginning of the report it is explained what a PUF is and why it is important to identify the authenticity of IoT devices.

After that, a specific type of PUF, the SRAM PUF, was presented: its functionality and its properties were listed.

In the last part, it was explained in detail the implementation done in this project, giving some details on which operations have to be executed on the host side and on the bord side.

In the end, the results obtained with this approach were analyzed. Moreover, some possible implementations and improvements to increase the security of the PUF were presented.
