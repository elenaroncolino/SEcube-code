\chapter{Conclusions}
%This final chapter is used to recap what you did in the project. No detail, just a high-level summary of your project (1 page or a bit less is usually enough, but it depends on the specific project).
In Conclusion, this project presents a possible implementation of a physical unclonable function (PUF) in order to test the authenticity of a device.
\\
\\
In particolar, at the beginning of the report it is explained what a PUF is and why it is important to recognise IoT devices.
\\
\\
After that, it was presented a specific type of PUF: SRAM PUF; and it was explained its functionality and its properties.
\\
\\
In the last part, it was explained deeply the implementation done in this project, giving some details on which operations have to be executed on the host side and which one on the bord side.
\\
\\
In the end, it was analyzed the results obtained with this approach. Moreover, it was introduced some possible implementations in order to increase the security of the PUF presented.
